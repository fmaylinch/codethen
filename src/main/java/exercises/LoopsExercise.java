		// We'll work with this array
		int[] numbers = { 3, 14, 2, 7, 6, 3, 7 };


		// For the exercises, suppose that you
		// don't know the numbers in the array.
		// In other words, if I change the array
		// the exercises should still be right.
		// Look at the array only to check the answers.

		// Note: I'll say "position" or "index", meaning
		//       one of the available positions/places
		//       of the array (0, 1, 2, etc.)


		
		// 1 - Display the length of the array


		// 2 - Display the 3rd element in the array


		// 3 - Calculate the sum of the first and the last element (just 2 numbers)


		// 4 - Display all the numbers


		// 5 - Display just the numbers at even positions: 14, 7, 3


		// 6 - Calculate the sum of all numbers


		// 7 - Calculate the sum of the numbers at odd positions: 3, 2, 6, 7


		// 8 - Calculate the average of the numbers (total sum divided by number)


		// 9 - Find the maximum number (hint: you'll need an `if` too)


		// 10 - Find the minimum number


		// More difficult:


		// 11 - Display the number at the index indicated by the number at index 5 (what?? read again, hehe)


		// 12 - Find numbers whose index is the same as the number itself (what!!?? haha, read again!)


		// 13 - Swap the number at position 0 with the last number of the array.
		//      When I say "swap" I mean you have to change the positions of those
		//      numbers: move each one of them to the position of the other.
		//      Note: with `numbers[0] = XXX;` you change the first value in the array.


		// 14 - Swap the number at position 0 with the smallest value in the array


		// 15 - Given some start index swap the number at that index with the smallest
		//      number from that index. For example, if `start` is 3, find the smallest
		//      number from that index, ignoring lower indexes like 0, 1, 2.
		//      Just look from index 3 and above. Then swap the numbers.
		int start = 3;


		// OK, you reached here! Even MORE difficult:


		// 16 - Find the repeated numbers (hint: you'll need a loop inside another)


		// 17 - Sort the array using the "selection sort algorithm":
		//      Start at index 0 and do what you did in exercise 15.
		//      Then move to index 1 and do the same.
		//      Then move to index 2 and do the same.
		//      When you get to the end of the array (to the last index) you're done!
		//      So, in other words, what you have to do is to repeat the process you
		//      did in ex 15 for every index in the array.
