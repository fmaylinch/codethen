# Mongo Example

This is an example of connecting to Mongo via the Java driver.

Here you can download the [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community).

Start server with `mongod` and client (shell) with `mongo`.
In Windows you need to create the folder `C:\data\db` before starting `mongod`.

In [Java Driver Tutorials](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.5/driver/tutorials/) you can learn how to use mongo from Java.

And here docs about using the mongo shell (command line):
- [Connect to MongoDB via Mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/tutorials/connect-to-mongodb-shell/)
- [The mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/)
- [Getting Started with MongoDB (MongoDB Shell Edition)](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/)

You may want to try [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/), formerly "Robomongo", a native MongoDB management tool (Admin UI). Although the mongo shell is enough for most cases.
