 * This is a example program.
 * Open the Terminal and go to the folder where this file is located.
 * Compile with: javac JavaSample.java
 * Compilation will check the code.
 * - If there's something wrong you will see an error.
 * - If it's right it doesn't say anything and generates JavaSample.class
 * The JavaSample.class file is the executable (runnable) file.
 * Run the program with: java JavaSample
 * Note you don't include the class extension when running the program.
 *
 * To create a new program, you can copy this file,
 * rename it, e.g. AnotherProgram.java,
 * and also change the class name right here below this line.
